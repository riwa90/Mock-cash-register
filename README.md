# Mock cash register

This is a school project done in course IV1350 as part of KTHs BSc programme in Computer Engineering.

The program is a mock cash register, without a UI or database. It's not really a functional program, it's an exercise in object oriented programming in Java. 

The program architecture was first drawn, then the program was built. The code follows the MVC-pattern. The code have tests for all classes written in the JUnit 5 framework.
